# React Sequencer

Probably one of the sketchiest step sequencer on the web, created while having fun with React + React Hooks + React Context + Typescript.

IMPORTANT: To make it work, create a [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) Api Key and store its value in FREESOUND_API_KEY (.env configuration file).

#### `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

#### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
